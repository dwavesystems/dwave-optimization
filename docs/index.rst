  philosophy

`dwave-optimization` and the hybrid nonlinear solver incorporate features and
:ref:`design principals <optimization_philosophy>` from each of the following
areas:

.. developer note: this will look funny when built locally but looks fine as
   part of the sdk

.. grid:: 2 2 3 2
    :gutter: 2

    .. grid-item-card:: Quantum Optimization
        :img-top: /_images/optimization_quantum_icon.svg
        :link: optimization_philosophy_quantum_optimization
        :link-type: ref

        Take advantage of quantum-mechanical effects not available to classical
        compute.

    .. grid-item-card:: (Mixed-Integer) Linear Programming
        :img-top: /_images/optimization_lp_icon.svg
        :link: optimization_philosophy_linear_programming
        :link-type: ref

        Learn the basics of solving optimization problems with linear program
        solvers.

    .. grid-item-card:: Lists, Sets, and Other Combinatorial Variables
        :img-top: /_images/optimization_combinatorial_icon.svg
        :link: optimization_philosophy_combinatorial_variables
        :link-type: ref

        Explore how lists, sets, and other combinatorial structures make
        optimization simpler and more performant.

    .. grid-item-card:: Tensor Programming
        :img-top: /_images/optimization_tensor_icon.svg
        :link: optimization_philosophy_tensor_programming
        :link-type: ref

        Use N-dimensional arrays and operations to work with your data directly
        and succinctly.
