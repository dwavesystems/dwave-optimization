    Added ``FirstInstanceNode`` cpp base class which returns the smallest index
    (should it exist) of element of an array where the `condition` is true. The
    `condition` must be defined by derived class.  Returns -1 if no such index
    exists.
    Added ``Find`` symbol/node which returns the smallest index (should it
    exist) of a non-zero element of predecessor. This class is derived from
    FirstInstanceNode.
