    The ``Constant`` symbol is now able to pass ownership of the corresponding
    numpy array to the ``ConstantNode`` which prevents the numpy array from
    being garbage collected even after the symbol has been collected. This
    means it is no longer necessary to save references to all the numpy arrays
    used by ``Constant`` symbols on the model itself. To support this, a new
    constructor for the C++ ``ConstantNode`` has been added which takes a
    special ``ConstantNode::DataSource`` struct allowing the Python reference
    count to modified when appropriate.
