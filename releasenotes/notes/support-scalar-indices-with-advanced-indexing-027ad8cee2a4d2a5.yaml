features:
  - |
    Fully support scalar (0-dimensional) indices for advanced indexing
    operations, e.g. ``A[i, :, j, :]`` where ``i`` and ``j`` are nodes with
    scalar output. Previously, this would work only if the final output of the
    indexing operation was also scalar.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix the case of using scalar indices in an advanced indexing operation
    where the indices were not grouped, e.g. ``A[:, i, :, j]``, which was
    technically unsupported but no errors were raised. This could also lead
    to segfaults during state initialization or propagation.
