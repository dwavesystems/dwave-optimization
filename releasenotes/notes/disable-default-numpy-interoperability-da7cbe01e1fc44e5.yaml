upgrade:
  - |
    Opt ``ArraySymbol`` out of NumPy interoperability. This means that trying
    to use an ``ArraySymbol`` with most NumPy functions/operators will fail.
    Prefer to use the functions in ``dwave.optimization.mathematical``.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix type promotion when using NumPy arrays as the left-hand-side of
    operations with ``ArraySymbol``.
