features:
  - |
    Add the ``Expression`` class, similar to ``Model``, meant to represent
    mathematical or computational expressions leveraging the same underlying
    ``Graph`` as ``Model``, but excludes decision symbols and certain other
    types of symbols.
  - |
    Add the ``NaryReduce`` symbol and corresponding ``NaryReduceNode`` node in
    the C++. This symbol computes an arbitrary reduction operation on 1-d
    arrays, similar to ``numpy.ufunc.reduce``, except that it takes any number
    of operands/predecessors. The reduction operation is supplied by the user
    and encoded as an ``Expression``.
