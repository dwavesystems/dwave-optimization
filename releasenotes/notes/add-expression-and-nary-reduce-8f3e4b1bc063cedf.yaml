features:
  - Add ``expression()`` decorator for constructing expressions.
  - |
    Add the ``NaryReduce`` symbol and corresponding ``NaryReduceNode`` node in
    the C++. This symbol computes an arbitrary reduction operation on 1-d
    arrays, similar to ``numpy.ufunc.reduce``, except that it takes any number
    of operands/predecessors. The reduction operation is supplied by the user
    and encoded as an ``Expression``.
