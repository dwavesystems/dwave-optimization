    Using advanced indexing nodes with indexing arrays that have a higher dimension than
    one (e.g. ``A[:, i, :, j]`` where ``i`` and ``j`` are 2d arrays) has been disabled.
    Previously, it was possible to construct models that used this functionality, but
    the behavior of the model during state initialization and propagation may not have
    been correct.
