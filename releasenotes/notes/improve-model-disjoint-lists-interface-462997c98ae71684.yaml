features:
  - |
    ``DisjointLists`` symbols are now indexable, returning the corresponding
    ``DisjointList`` (singular) symbol for the given index. This allows the
    method of creating disjoint lists on the model to be simplified, returning
    only a ``DisjointLists`` symbol instead of a tuple of the symbol and a
    list of ``DisjointList`` symbols. A new method
    ``Model.disjoint_lists_symbol()`` has been added to the Model class which
    implements this.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``Model.disjoint_lists()`` method has been deprecated. Use
    ``Model.disjoint_lists_symbol()`` instead.
