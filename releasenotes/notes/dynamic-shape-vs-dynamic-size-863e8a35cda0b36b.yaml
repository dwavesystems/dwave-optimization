features:
  - |
    Allow array symbols to have a state-dependent shape while not having a
    state-dependent size. For example, an array with shape ``(n, 0)`` will
    always have a size of ``0``, but the shape is state-dependent.

    Arrays with a state-dependent size always have a state-depenent shape.
upgrade:
  - |
    Change the definition of ``ArrayNode::dynamic()`` to return ``true`` if
    ``ArrayNode::shape()[0] < 0``. That is, if the shape is state-dependent.
    Previously ``ArrayNode::dynamic()`` returned true if the size was
    state-dependent.
fixes:
  - |
    Support broadcasting arrays to a shape with a ``0`` in one or more dimensions
    with the ``BroadcastTo`` symbol.
