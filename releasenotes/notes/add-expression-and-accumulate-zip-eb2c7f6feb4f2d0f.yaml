features:
  - Add ``expression()`` decorator for constructing expressions.
  - |
    Add the ``AccumulateZip`` symbol and corresponding ``AccumulateZipNode``
    node in the C++. This symbol computes an arbitrary accumulate operation on
    1-d arrays, similar to ``numpy.ufunc.accumulate``, except that it takes any
    number of operands/predecessors. The accumulate operation is supplied by
    the user and encoded as an ``Expression``.
