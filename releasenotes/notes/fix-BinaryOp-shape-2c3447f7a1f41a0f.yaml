fixes:
  - |
    Change C++ function ``broadcast_shape()`` correctly throw an error when
    an attempt to broadcast a dynamically sized shape would result in an invalid
    result.
    See `#429 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-optimization/issues/429>`_.
  - |
    Fix ``BinaryNode::shape(const State&)`` and ``BinaryNode::size(const State&)``
    so that they do not propagate the wrong shape/size when both predecessors
    have the same shape.
