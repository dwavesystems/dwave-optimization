fixes:
  - Fix C++ ``SizeInfo::substitute()`` method. Previously it would not correctly update the min/max.

    Fix C++ ``BasicIndexingNode::sizeinfo()`` and ``AdvancedIndexingNode::sizeinfo()`` methods.
    Previously they would sometimes report incorrect size information when indexing or being indexed by dynamic nodes.
